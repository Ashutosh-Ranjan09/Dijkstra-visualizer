# 🗺️ Dijkstra's Algorithm Visualizer

Ever wondered how GPS navigation finds the shortest route to your destination? This interactive visualizer brings Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm to life! Watch as the algorithm explores a graph step-by-step, finding the optimal path between any two points.

## ✨ What makes this special?

This isn't just another algorithm demo - it's an **interactive learning experience** that helps you understand one of computer science's most fundamental algorithms through visual storytelling.

### 🎯 Perfect for

- **Students** learning graph algorithms and data structures
- **Educators** teaching shortest path algorithms
- **Developers** who want to see Dijkstra's algorithm in action
- **Anyone curious** about how pathfinding works behind the scenes

### 🚀 Features

- **Interactive graph building** - Click to create nodes and edges
- **Real-time visualization** - Watch the algorithm work step by step
- **Customizable weights** - Set different costs for each path
- **Responsive design** - Works beautifully on desktop and mobile
- **Dark mode support** - Easy on the eyes during those late study sessions

## 🏃‍♂️ Quick Start

Ready to explore? Getting started is super simple:

```bash
# Clone the project
git clone https://github.com/Ashutosh-Ranjan09/Dijkstra-visualizer.git
cd Dijkstra-visualizer

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Launch the visualizer
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and start building your first graph! 🎉

## 🎮 How to Use

1. **Create nodes** by clicking anywhere on the canvas
2. **Connect nodes** by dragging from one node to another
3. **Set edge weights** by clicking on the connection lines
4. **Choose start and end points** by selecting nodes
5. **Run the algorithm** and watch the magic happen!

The visualizer will show you exactly how Dijkstra's algorithm explores the graph, updates distances, and eventually finds the shortest path.
